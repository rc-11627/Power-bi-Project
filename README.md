🌆 City Pulse: Smart Urban Mobility & Safety Dashboard

An end‑to‑end Power BI project built to analyze and visualize urban traffic, accidents, air quality, mobility patterns, and public sentiment across major Indian cities. Designed with a strong focus on real-world analytics, storytelling, and decision-oriented insights, this dashboard stands out as an interview-ready portfolio project.

🧭 Project Title

City Pulse – Urban Mobility, Pollution & Road Safety Insights Dashboard (2021–2024)
A multi-page interactive Power BI dashboard that uncovers how traffic density, AQI, rainfall, and public behavior influence urban safety and daily commute patterns.

📌 Project Overview

The City Pulse Dashboard offers a holistic view of urban challenges in India’s top cities. It transforms raw multi-year data into actionable insights related to:
Traffic congestion

Road accidents & city safety

Air quality patterns (PM2.5, PM10, AQI)

Weather influence (temperature, humidity, rainfall)

Public sentiment trends

City-level benchmarking

The project demonstrates expertise in data modeling, DAX, visual analytics, and urban domain understanding.

🛠 Tech Stack

This dashboard was built using:

Power BI Desktop – Visuals, layouts, modeling

Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, merging

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated measures, KPIs & logic

CSV/Excel – Data validation & structuring

.pbix – Final Power BI report file

📁 Data Source

A custom-generated dataset inspired by real-world Indian conditions.

Dataset Characteristics:

x10,000+ rows

4 years (2021–2024)

10 major cities: Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Pune, Ahmedabad, Jaipur,Surat

14+ attributes, including:

Date

City

Traffic Density

Avg Vehicles per Day

Accident Count

AQI / PM2.5 / PM10

Temperature

Humidity

Rainfall

public Transport Disruption

Event Ongoing

Commute Time



Data includes missing values and duplicates.

🎯 Business Problem

Urban administrators and transportation planners need a unified view to understand:

Why accident rates rise in specific cities and months

How pollution & weather impact traffic flow

Which cities consistently struggle with congestion

How public sentiment shifts with road & air conditions

Which seasonal patterns create the highest risks

The dashboard helps build evidence-based safety, mobility, and pollution policies.

🥅 Goal of the Dashboard

To build an analytical solution that:

Tracks key mobility & safety KPIs

Reveals patterns in accidents, traffic & AQI

Compares city performance on a single canvas

Identifies hotspots & high-risk seasons

Supports strategic actions for smarter cities

This is built as a portfolio-quality Power BI case study.

🔍 Key Insights

Here are 10 high-impact insights:

Delhi reports the highest accident average (414), aligned with high AQI and traffic density.

Mumbai peaks in accidents during monsoon months (June–September).

Bengaluru shows high sentiment but suffers from increasing accident trends.

Jaipur remains the safest city with the lowest accidents and AQI levels and with highest sentiment as well.

High traffic density zones show 40–50% higher accident frequency.

AQI worsens in winter for Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, impacting commute time.

Rainfall has a direct correlation with increased accident risk in coastal cities.

Avg commute time increases by 15+ minutes during peak AQI periods.

Festivals & political events lead to noticeable spikes in traffic & accidents.

Cities with public transport adoption show lower congestion impact.

💼 Business Impact

This dashboard empowers decision-makers by:

Pinpointing high-risk cities, months, and patterns

Supporting data-backed urban policy creation

Improving road safety & congestion planning

Boosting environmental monitoring strategies

Enhancing commute efficiency & citizen experience
